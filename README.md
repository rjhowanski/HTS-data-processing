S4a HTRF interpolation: script reads HTRF readout file (384-well) based on file names and assumes concentration of controls and blanks in columns 23 and 24 (standardized liquid handler methods ensure these concentrations), and script interpolates concentrations of samples (columns 1-22) assuming quad-stamped (Z-format) into 384-well with 4-point titration during stamp. This titration series is to accommodate the dynamic range of HTRF assays. Script considers the proximity of sample readouts to EC50 of standard and max signals to make selections from dilution series to calculate concentration. Dilution factors are incorporated into the script but can be updated to account for changes in protocol. Additionally, the positive control standard concentrations are hard coded but can be updated to accommodate changes in protocol.
